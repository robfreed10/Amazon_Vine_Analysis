# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The analysis for this project was to look at reviews for diifferent types of Video Games across all consoles and all games that are sold across Amazon's web-marketplace. I wanted to see if there was any bias in the ratings that were paid for (Vine) and the ratings that were unpaid for (non-Vine)

## Results 
 - How many Vine Reviews (paid) and Non-Vine Reviews (unpaid) were there?
 Paid: 94 
 Unpaid: 40,471

## Summary
Overall, I don't believe there is any bias towards the Amazon Vine Review Program for Video Games. For starters, the amount of Vine reviews is so much smaller then Non-Vine reviews. Perhaps, this Amazon Vine Program is too expensive for the common user who are buying video games, which is already an expensive industry to begin with. While the percentage of paid reviews is 51.06%, there is just not enough Data to make conclusions about positivity bias
